CPSC 233 Team Project
TUTORIAL 5 GROUP 21 

Monopoly reimagined with obect oriented programming.
Our game will illustrate the logic of a typical board game structure by determining whose turn it is, what a valid move is, when the game is over and who won the game, and finally coming up with a smart strategy for the computer to make moves and act as a player. Our goal by the end of this project is to create a complete and functioning board game program that may be effectively used by other people
