CPSC 233 Team Project
TUTORIAL 5 GROUP 21 

Monopoly reimagined with obect oriented programming.
Our game will illustrate the logic of a typical board game structure by determining whose turn it is, what a valid move is, when the game is over and who won the game, and finally coming up with a smart strategy for the computer to make moves and act as a player. Our goal by the end of this project is to create a complete and functioning board game program that may be effectively used by other people.

# Rules

- Each player takes turn to roll
- Once they roll, their icon will move to that position on the board
- At that position on the board, a prompt will pop up and will ask them a simple question in which they must response to
- After that, this will continue for each player until there is only one player left standing

## Verison 1

To find the version for our demo1 look through the branch version1. Download the folder named Monopoly/src and run the class named "GameConfiguration".

You will be given prompts and will need to response to let in order to process through the game.

## Version 2

To find the version for our demo2 look through the branch version2. Download the folder named Monopoly/src and run the class named "Main.java".

You will then see a GUI that you can interact with and be allow to click buttons and see labels.
